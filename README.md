HOI4 Modding AI Reference Database

A high-density, structured reference database for Hearts of Iron IV modding, specifically optimized for Large Language Models (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.).

This repository converts the human-readable HOI4 Wiki into strict JSON schemas and "Edge Case" text files. It allows AI agents to write high-quality, bug-free mod code by referencing actual game rules rather than hallucinating syntax.
