# Needed Database Updates

- `ai_bonus_weights_documentation.md`: No coverage found in the database. Add a new page/section (likely under `content/` AI systems) that documents AI bonus weights (default/archetype weights, error behavior when missing). Include examples and schema from the doc.
- `ai_equipment_documentation.md`: Coverage exists in `content/ai_strategy.md` (AI Equipment section) but needs updating to match the new doc: add priority blocks, target_variant/module matching, requirements, allowed_modules lists, enable/blocked/available, and any new tokens/examples.
- `ai_faction_theaters_documentation.md`: Missing coverage. Add AI faction theater documentation (regions list, can_skip_first_region flag, preferred_countries, ai_will_do/cancel scopes, connectivity note) in the AI systems area.
- `ai_navy_documentation.md`: Missing coverage. Add goal-based naval AI documentation (goals/objectives, scoring, objective types, priority ranges, debugging via `imgui show ai_navy`) under AI systems.
- `ai_peace_documentation.md`: Coverage exists in `content/ai_strategy.md` (AI Peace 1.14+) but may be outdated. Update to the new `peace_ai_desires` structure and scope semantics (`ROOT` negotiator, `FROM` taker, `FROM.FROM` giver, `FROM.FROM.FROM` state; action types `take_states/puppet/force_government/liberate`), multiple-desire summing, zero-disable rules, and peace-conference trigger refs.
- `ai_strategy_documentation.md`: File exists but lacks many 2024-11 tokens/details (equipment market strategies, raid targets, naval dominance/convoy raiding targets, research weighting, production minimums, new unit_ratio behavior, etc.). Expand `content/ai_strategy.md` accordingly.
- `characters_documentation.md`: Database covers characters but lacks the new scientist role section. Add scientist role docs (desc, traits, skills, visible trigger, defaults) to `entities/characters.md`.
- `collections_documentation.md`: No database coverage. Add a new scripting page on collections (definition, creation, anonymous collections, built-ins like game:all_countries, country:faction_members, collection_size trigger, every_collection_element effect).
- `console_commands_documentation.md`: Database page is far shorter than the new doc. Expand `core/console_commands.md` to include the full updated command list (MIO/market/special projects, debug/tweakable variables, aliases, arguments, release-build notes).
- `cost_modifiers_documentation.md`: No coverage. Add peace conference cost modifier doc (scope mapping, action types, categories, cost_multiplier guidance) to the peace/AI section.
- `decisions_documentation.md`: No coverage found. Add a detailed decisions page covering allowed/visible/available, target_root_trigger, target_trigger, state_trigger performance notes, and targeted decision lifecycle.
- `doctrines_documentation.md`: No doctrines page in DB. Add doctrine system coverage (folders, grand doctrines, tracks, milestones, subdoctrines, mastery, rewards, triggers, effects, modifiers) under military/systems.
- `dynamic_variables_documentation.md`: No dedicated coverage; add a dynamic variables reference (scopes: global/country/state/unit_leader/MIO/special_project) with descriptions/examples, especially AI strategy values and new power balance/intel fields.
- `effects_documentation.md`: `scripting/effects.md` exists but is shorter; expand with full up-to-date effects reference matching the new doc (categories, parameters, nuances, any new effects).
- `equipment_documentation.md`: Coverage exists in `military/equipment.md` but may need expansion for ai_type, module slots/count limits, default_modules, resources/stats, production limits per the new doc.
- `equipment_groups_documentation.md`: No coverage. Add equipment group DB page (grouping types/archetypes/categories, include other groups, optional description, equipment_bonus usage) under military/systems or scripting.
- `factions_documentation.md`: `entities/factions.md` exists but lacks the new detailed goal/rule/template/range/progress/AI spending sections. Expand to match the new doc.
- `folders_documentation.md`: No coverage. Add doctrine folders page (top-level categorization, UI fields, allowed, ledger options) under doctrines/military.
- `grand_doctrines_documentation.md`: No coverage. Add grand doctrine page (folder link, xp_cost/xp_type, tracks, milestones, activation effects including modifiers/tactics/equipment bonuses/effects; max_track_rows/columns).
- `intelligence_agency_upgrades_documentation.md`: Coverage exists in `military/intel_agencies.md` but may need expansion for full schema (picture/frame/sound, ai_will_do, modifiers_during_progress, multi-level modifiers/effects). Verify and align with the new doc.
- `loc_formatter_documentation.md`: Coverage exists in `assets/localisation.md` (formatters list) but may need full parameter/examples for advisor_desc, building_state_modifier, character_name, country_culture, country_leader_desc, idea_desc/name, tech_effect.
- `loc_objects_documentation.md`: No coverage. Add localization objects reference (Ace/Building/Character/Country/Faction/IndustrialOrg/Operation/Province/PurchaseContract/Scope/SpecialProject/State/Terrain/UnitLeader, properties/promotions) under localisation.
- `ai_templates_documentation.md`: Coverage exists in `content/ai_strategy.md` (AI templates section) but may need alignment with the new examples: role-level entries, upgrade_prio/enable/replace_with chains, target_template structure, match scores, field upgrades, debugging (`imgui show ai_templates`, `imgui show ai_division_production`), gating by tech/date/equipment.
- `modifiers_documentation.md`: `scripting/modifiers.md` plus modifiers_list pages exist but may not mirror the new full reference. Integrate/expand with categories, schema examples, percent/flat/multiplicative, dynamic/static/targeted/opinion, variable-based modifiers, ensuring links stay valid.
- `on_actions_documentation.md`: `scripting/on_actions_core.md` and `scripting/on_actions_reference.md` exist; update them to the full 2024-11 enumeration and scope notes (new entries, deprecated notes).

- `policies_documentation.md`: `military/mios.md` includes policies; ensure it matches the new doc (cost/cooldown, allowed/visible/available evaluation, equipment_bonus/production_bonus keyed by groups/categories/archetypes with same_as_mio, organization_modifier, on_add/on_remove, ai_will_do).
- `raids_documentation.md`: No coverage. Add raids system page (categories, targeting UI rules, icons, command power, arrows, unit models/equipment requirements, intel source, success levels/outcomes, success_factors, cooldowns, allowed/visible/available/launchable/launchable_from, starting_point constraints).
- `resources_documentation.md`: Database lacks the note about updating `NAI::MIN_FACTORIES_TO_WANT_TO_IMPORT` and import desire gating. Add this define guidance to `database/resources.md`.
- `scientist_traits_documentation.md`: Add scientist trait schema (name/icon, modifier for special projects, specialization gating, available trigger in country scope) under characters/scientists.
- `script_collection_input.md`: No coverage. Add collections input reference page (game:all_countries/all_possible_countries/all_states, game:scope, named collections, constants) with examples.
