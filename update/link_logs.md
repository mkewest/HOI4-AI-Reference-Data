# Link Suggestions (per AI_beta_report_instructions.md)

- Add crosslinks from `content/ai_strategy.md` to new/updated AI system pages for bonus weights, equipment designs, naval goals, faction theaters, and peace conference desires once added.
- When adding the AI peace conference update, link to peace-conference trigger reference (if present) and to `defines_list/NAI.md` for related defines.
- Link equipment-market strategy tokens to the relevant market/economy docs (if present) when updating `content/ai_strategy.md`.
- Link the new scientist role section from `entities/characters.md` to any scientist traits/organizations docs once added.
- Add links from the new collections page to triggers/effects that consume collections, and back-links from scripting triggers/effects pages.
- Update `core/console_commands.md` with anchors so other pages (debug tools, scripting data types) can deep-link to specific command categories.
- When adding peace cost modifiers, crosslink with the AI peace doc and any peace-conference trigger reference.
- Add links from the decisions page to targeted decision examples and to performance guidance sections if present elsewhere.
- When adding doctrines coverage, link from modifiers (doctrine mastery) and research/docs referencing doctrine systems.
- Add links from a future dynamic variables page to scripting data types and to sections that use these variables (AI strategies, power balance, intel).
- Expand effects page anchors so triggers/effects crossrefs and script docs can deep-link to specific effect categories.
- Add equipment page links to module docs, archetype/type enums, and AI production references.
- Add equipment group page links to MIOS and equipment_bonus usage examples.
- Add links from expanded faction goals/rules/templates to related effects/triggers in `entities/factions.md` and to peace cost modifiers where referenced.

- Link raids page from intel/raid systems, defines, and triggers/effects using raids.
- Add link from resources doc to defines (`NAI::MIN_FACTORIES_TO_WANT_TO_IMPORT`) and trade/import guidance.

- Link collections inputs/operators/concepts from scripting triggers/effects using collections, and back from localisation/loc objects where collections appear.
- Link scripted GUIs page from interface/scripting references and debugging guides.
- Link subdoctrines/tracks/grand doctrines/folders pages together and from doctrine overviews.
- Link taskforce composition page from naval AI/OOB/taskforce goal docs.
